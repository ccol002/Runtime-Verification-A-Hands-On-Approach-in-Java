Welcome!
This is the code accompanying the book "Runtime Verification: A Hands-On Approach in Java". 

As explained in Chapter 3 of the text, projects correspond to the book exercises. 
Simply import the code into your favourite IDE, read the book, and start coding away :) 

The solutions folders offer you guidance where you get stuck, and come in handy if you have skipped any chapters which are a prerequisite for later ones.

Hope you find this useful. 
If you have any questions or comments please don't hesitate to get in touch with us!

PS: Prof. Owolabi Legunsen from Cornell University has kindly let us know that he is "mavenising" the code available in this repository. 
If this sounds convenient to you, the latest code is available at: https://github.com/owolabileg/fits-in-maven
